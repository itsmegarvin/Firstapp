->two methods for react native
1.  without using expo
2.  using expo

-> while using expo you can encounter problem of app.js/app.tsx not seen inside root.     if app.js is not visible then delete the project
do not directly run that command 

1) run this instead :
npm install -g expo-cli
2) after that run :
expo init my-new-project
3) then go to the directory:
cd my-new-project
4) and run the project


-> The Local Expo CLI was introduced in Expo SDK 46, so it is defined in package.json as
            "private": true,
            "resolutions":{
                "@expo/cli":"xxx"
            }
    this solves the problem for the error like "global expo cli has been deprecated"

-> view, button, text are components(like tags in html)

->Text,View,Button and concept of SafeAreaView in StatusBar
