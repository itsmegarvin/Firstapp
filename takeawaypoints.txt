1>two methods for react native
a.  without using expo
b.  using expo

2> while using expo you can encounter problem of app.js/app.tsx not seen inside root.     if app.js is not visible then delete the project
do not directly run that command 

a) run this instead :
npm install -g expo-cli
b) after that run :
expo init my-new-project
c) then go to the directory:
cd my-new-project
d) and run the project


3> The Local Expo CLI was introduced in Expo SDK 46, so it is defined in package.json as
            "private": true,
            "resolutions":{
                "@expo/cli":"xxx"
            }
    this solves the problem for the error like "global expo cli has been deprecated"

4> view, button, text are components(like tags in html)
    a) all the components imported from react native have first letter capital unlike html tags have first letter capital.
    b) View is not needed for only one text component but necessary for more than one text components
    c) also we cannot write only in View component it shows error.

5> about jsx. jsx is said as javascript xml but on official website it is said as syntax extention to javascript.
    a) before jsx we had to made the separate script to write the javascript code and then only we would be able to use it with html code.
    b)  we can now write html tags and react native components inside javascript 

6> components in react native
    a)independent and reusable such as function
    b)two types of components (functional,class based)
    c)why different component folder is needed?

    function Vs component

7> button and onpress event.    
    a) mobile application so press not click
    b) button properties like title,color,onpress.
