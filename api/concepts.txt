1. first we learn to fetch and make use api found in internet like jsonplaceholder.
2. then make fake api/ domi api using json server because to test put,patch,delete we must use our own api we can't from the internet.
3. install json server using command 
        npm install -g json-server
            make folder inside project as api/db.json and again run,
        json server --watch db.json
            this runs api locally in local port.  like http:localhost//3000  paste this in browser to use

            Task	                Needs Browser?
        Running JSON Server	            ❌ No
        Making requests to it	        ❌ No
        Viewing response in browser	    ✅ Optional
        
        learn to use postman
4. now to make your own api run in internet server use commands
        ipconfig
        json server --host 0.0.0.0 db.json
        then goto browser and paste ip address and port like 192.168.108.1:3000
